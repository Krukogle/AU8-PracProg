----------- PART A ----------
Newton's method with numerical gradient, numerical Hessian matrix and back-tracking linesearch.

The Rosenbrock's valley function f(x,y) = (1-x)² + 100*(y-x²)²
According to Wikipedia, the global minimum is at (1, 1²) = (1, 1)...
Initial guess for Rosenbrock's valley function:
         2          2 
Minimum of Rosenbrock's valley function found at:
         1          1 
Number of iterations: 14
Is this correct within a tolerance of 1%? True

The Himmelblau's function f(x,y) = (x² + y - 11)² + (x + y² - 7)²
According to Wikipedia, it has one local maximum and four local minima.
We will try to find the minimum at (x, y) = (3, 2)...
Initial guess for Himmelblau's function:
         5          5 
Minimum of Himmelblau's function found at:
         3          2 
Number of iterations: 6
Is this correct within a tolerance of 1%? True

----------- PART B ----------
Higgs boson discovery.

Fitting the Breit-Wigner function by minimising the deviation function D(m, Γ, A)...
Initial guess for Higgs boson fit parameters (m, Γ, A):
       125          3         10 
Minimum of the deviation function found at (m, Γ, A):
       126      2.086      9.876 
Number of iterations: 8
Fit data for Higgs saved to 'higgs_fit.txt'. The plot 'higgs.pdf' shows the results.

----------- PART C ----------
Part A, but with central differences for the gradient and Hessian matrix.

Rosenbrock's valley function with central differences for gradient and Hessian matrix...
Minimum of Rosenbrock's valley function found at (central differences):
         1          1 
Number of iterations: 14
Is this correct within a tolerance of 1%? True

Himmelblau's function with central differences for gradient and Hessian matrix...
Minimum of Himmelblau's function found at (central differences):
         3          2 
Number of iterations: 6
Is this correct within a tolerance of 1%? True
So the central method works :)
To better compare the methods, we do the test again but starting very far away from the minimum...
